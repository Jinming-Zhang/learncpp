# Move Semantics
## Problem with auto_ptr and copy constructor
Dynamically allocated member variables cannot be properly copies over objects, therefore auto_ptr will leave a dangling pointer when  it's being copied/assigned to other auto_ptr variables.

We can't modify the copy constructor/assignment operator to free the memory of the copied variable, since it will implicit invalidate the variable every time the copy constructor/assignment operator is called, including pass-by-value to function parameter.

## Move Semantics
Transferring the ownership of one object to another.
Usually used when dealing with classes that have dynamically allocated member variables.

```cpp
template <typename T>
class Auto_ptr2
{
	T* m_ptr;
public:
	Auto_ptr2(T* ptr=nullptr)
		:m_ptr(ptr)
	{
	}

	~Auto_ptr2()
	{
		delete m_ptr;
	}

	// A copy constructor that implements move semantics
	Auto_ptr2(Auto_ptr2& a) // note: not const
	{
		m_ptr = a.m_ptr; // transfer our dumb pointer from the source to our local object
		a.m_ptr = nullptr; // make sure the source no longer owns the pointer
	}

	// An assignment operator that implements move semantics
	Auto_ptr2& operator=(Auto_ptr2& a) // note: not const
	{
		if (&a == this)
			return *this;

		delete m_ptr; // make sure we deallocate any pointer the destination is already holding first
		m_ptr = a.m_ptr; // then transfer our dumb pointer from the source to the local object
		a.m_ptr = nullptr; // make sure the source no longer owns the pointer
		return *this;
	}

	T& operator*() const { return *m_ptr; }
	T* operator->() const { return m_ptr; }
	bool isNull() const { return m_ptr == nullptr; }
};
```
