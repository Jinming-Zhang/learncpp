# Numeric Promotion
Type conversion of a narrower numeric type to a wider numeric type (i.e. int->double) that can be processed efficiently and less likely -pres

>Numeric Promotion are value preserving, they do not loss data or precision during conversion.

# Numeric Conversion
Type conversion between different numerical types, can loss precision or data depends on the types.

Implicit numeric conversion that will result in loss precision will generate compiler warning (except signed <=> unsigned).
