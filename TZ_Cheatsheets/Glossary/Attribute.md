# Attribute
AttributesÂ are a modern C++ feature that allows the programmer to provide the compiler with some additional data about the code. To specify an attribute, the attribute name is placed between double hard braces. Attributes are not statements -- rather, they can be used almost anywhere where they are contextually relevant.
```cpp
int main()
{
    switch (2)
    {
    case 1:
        std::cout << 1 << '\n';
        break;
    case 2:
        std::cout << 2 << '\n'; // Execution begins here
        [[fallthrough]]; // intentional fallthrough -- note the semicolon to indicate the null statement
    case 3:
        std::cout << 3 << '\n'; // This is also executed
        break;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
