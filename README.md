## Appendix
Why programs can't be ran on different machines
-- different cpu may have different instruction set, so the program needs to be compiled into machine code (instruction sequences) that suitable for the targeting cpu. If the program needs to be ran on a different cpu then it needs to be compiled (by a different compiler) again into the instructions that that cpu can understand.
