I WANT LEARN CPP
## Appendix
### Why programs can't be ran on different machines
-- different cpu may have different instruction set, so the program needs to be compiled into machine code (instruction sequences) that suitable for the targeting cpu. If the program needs to be ran on a different cpu then it needs to be compiled (by a different compiler) again into the instructions that that cpu can understand.
### Cpp Compiling Process
Compiling source code
Compile each cpp file to corresponding object fie
Linking object files and libraries
__Linker__ links all object files and libraries make produce an executable file.
to produce an executable that can be run, each code file in a program is compiled into an object file, and then the object files are linked into an executable.
